# Book Recommendation System with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### Warning: Before running the "ipynb" file, make sure you have uploaded the Books.csv (which is found in the compressed .gz archive) and Ratings.csv files.

### Overview:
- This Python script implements a Book Recommendation System using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering. 
- The system is built on a sparse matrix of user-book ratings and applies matrix factorization techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

### Key Features:
- Custom Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): a custom function for SVD on sparse matrices, calculating the singular values and vectors based on user-book interactions and comparing the its results with the ones generated by the python already  built in function.
- Book Recommender Class: A class to load, prepare, and filter book and rating data, and then train a recommendation model using matrix factorization.

### Libraries:
- pandas and numpy - for data manipulation.
- scipy.sparse - for handling sparse matrices.
- scipy.sparse.linalg - for calculating eigenvalues / SVD.
- seaborn and matplotlib - for data visualization.

### Implemented features:
- Custom SVD Function: The function custom_svd() performs SVD on sparse matrices. It calculates the left singular vectors (U), singular values (S), and the transpose of the right singular vectors (Vt).
It Uses eigen decomposition of the A^T * A matrix to extract singular values and vectors.
- BookRecommender Class (based on some mean estimations and training models):
  
    (1) Initialization - Setting up default values, including the number of "latent factors" (e.g., 20), and placeholders for datasets, mappings, and rating matrix.
  
    (2) Data Loading (load_data) - Loading book metadata and user-book ratings from CSV files; cleaning and preparing the data for further processing.
  
    (3) Matrix Preparation (prepare_matrix) - Constructing a sparse matrix where rows represent users and columns represent books, filtered based on minimum ratings for both users and books.
  
    (4) Training (train_model): Matrix factorization using SVD, accounting for user and book biases; training the recommendation model.

### More in depth features:
- Data Loading: It reads books and ratings data from CSV files, processes them (removes duplicates, handles missing values), and maps books and users to matrix indices.
- Matrix Construction: The ratings are organized into a sparse matrix where users and books are mapped to matrix rows and columns. This allows efficient storage and computation for large datasets.
- SVD Decomposition: The custom_svd function performs matrix decomposition, which is used in generating latent factors for users and books, enabling predictions for missing ratings.
- Model Training: The model computes biases for users and books, centers the matrix by removing these biases, and applies matrix factorization (SVD) to build recommendations.

### Purpose
- Personalized Book Recommendations: This system can suggest books to users based on their previous ratings and preferences, along with those of similar users.
- Collaborative Filtering: It leverages user and book interactions, uncovering latent relationships and patterns in the data to predict unknown ratings!
